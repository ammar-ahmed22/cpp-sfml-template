# C++ SFML Template
A simple template for using the SFML library in C++. CMake is implemented for compilation. Some helper classes are defined for ease of use.

A simple Makefile is created to run the CMake commands.

Everything is MacOS specific, changes will need to be made for Windows.

## Compilation
[SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) must be installed!

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ammar-ahmed22/cpp-sfml-template.git my-project
```

Change directory:
```bash
cd my-project
```

Compile the project:
```bash
make
```

Run the project:
```bash
make run
```
